                    My name is Cassidy Romario Lawrence, I'm a 24-year-old male currently
                    studying coding <br />
                    at Life Choices Academy. <br /><br />
                    I come from Rocklands Mitchell's Plain. <br />
                    My hobbies include playing video games, soccer and working out
                    occasionally. <br /><br />
                    I am a friendly individual, always up for new challenges. <br />I
                    always aspire to be a great team player. <br />I possess the ability
                    to work unsupervised, <br />I'm trustworthy, goal driven, punctual and
                    well-mannered. <br />I'm always eager to sharpen skills I've already
                    acquired. <br />
                    As well as learning new ones to improve myself and grow my skill set.
